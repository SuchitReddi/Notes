        <h1> Raspberry Pi Backup </h1>
        <p>
            <h3>RaspiBackup Tool</h3>
            Backing up data is important. Large files and storages might be hard to back up and maintain, but something as small as a raspberry pi should not be an issue.<br>
            So I started using a tool for backing up the whole RPi, which can be easily restored if needed.<br>
            The tool is called <a href="https://github.com/framps/raspiBackup" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">raspiBackup</a>. It's very easy to use.<br>
            Just install the tool, and run the command <code>sudo installation/install.sh</code> from the tool's root directory.<br>
            <img style="width: 70%;" src="/Notes/Misc/notes/tools/backup/raspiBackupInstall_en.gif" alt="raspiBackup"><br>
            Configure regular backups there. I stored my backups in an external SSD connected to the Pi.<br>

            The command to restore a RPi image to a usb drive is:<br>
            <code>sudo dd bs=1M if=path/to/image/fileserver-dd-backup-20240219-231054.img of=/dev/sdb status=progress
            </code><br>

            <h3>Own method</h3>
            Let's say the above tool stops working. There is a simple way to automate the dd backup by yourself.<br>
            Just download this <a href="/Notes/Misc/notes/tools/backup/backup.sh" target="_blank">script</a>, and edit the in and out paths as required. You can use crontab to automate the script as you want.<br>
            Don't forget to give executable rights by using <code>sudo chmod +x backup.sh</code>, and add the following line to crontab:<br>
            <code>0 3 * * 1 /path/to/backup.sh</code><br>
            This line runs the script every Monday at 3:00 AM.<br><br>

            I also made a tool called <a href="/Notes/Misc/notes/tools/backup/backupie.sh" target="_blank">backupie</a>, to maually run backup and restore.<br>

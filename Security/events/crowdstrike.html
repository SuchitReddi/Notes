    <center><h1>Crowd Strike Global Outage - 19/07/2024</h1></center>
    <p>Those were my beginning days as a SOC Analyst at Deloitte USI. It was an ordinary working day on Friday the 19th July 2024.<br>
       Around 10AM, it all started when one fellow analyst complained about a sudden BSOD while working. We thought there was some issue with his device. <br>
       But then another device got the same issue. Both of their laptops got struck in a reboot loop. The next one to show the BSOD was mine. <br>
       But unlike the previous two devices, my laptop recovered from it after the restart. More laptops started BSODing. By then, I knew something serious was going on.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
       Maybe someone hacked Deloitte? â€‹But I didn't know then that the whole world was affected by this. Analysts started experiencing the same thing over the next few hours.<br>
       Even though most systems recovered after the reboot, other services like Deloitte VPN stopped working. A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">post</a> on reddit about BSOD due to Crowd Strike Falcon Sensors started gaining traction.<br>
       That post made me realize how big the issue was. It affected the whole world. The Crowd Strike Falcon Sensor update was the culprit. <br>

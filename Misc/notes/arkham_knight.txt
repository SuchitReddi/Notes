Installed from fitgirl repacks.

Faced issue of saves not... well, saving.

To make it work, edit CPY.ini (Batman - Arkham Knight>Binaries>Win64>CPY.ini)
There in the save path, change it to this (C:\Games\Batman - Arkham Knight\Binaries\Win64)
Be careful to change the path to where you installed your game.

Then go to the properties of Batman - Arkham Knight folder and change these settings.

Tick the boxes:
Folder is ready for archiving
Allow files in this folder to have contents indexed in addition to file properties

Untick the boxes:
Compress contents to save disk space

Now this game started saving properly.
